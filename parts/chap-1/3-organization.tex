\section{Organization of this thesis}
This thesis is organized in five main chapters, including this one. 

\begin{itemize}
	%\item This chapter gives a general overview of the subject, the related works and what to find in this work.
	\item The second chapter presents the different reduction methods used as well as the SVM and the nearest neighbors models.
	\item The third chapter explains the existing techniques to achieve privacy and a justification for the method we opted for, the context and theoretical foundations used in the method we opted for as well as the algorithms we used using this setting.
	\item The fourth chapter presents the results for each model, first the reduction methods and then the results on MPC. The models are tested in this order: linear SVMs, non-linear SVMs and finally nearest neighbors.
	\item The fifth chapter finally concludes the thesis summarizing the results and presenting directions for future works.
\end{itemize}

A lot of data has been produced during the evaluation of the results of the different algorithms. We tried to limit ourselves to a strict minimum in the fourth section. Additional results can be found in the appendix. The appendices also contain information on the code used for the various implementations.
